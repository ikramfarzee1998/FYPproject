# FYPproject
my fyp projects is about a vending machine that could display the number of stock and the location of the vending machine via Blynk App. Not only that it count the stock it also alert user if the number of stock is low or finish.

The way it work is whenever the number of stock reach below 3 it will send an alert saying that vending machine stock is low. Next alert will trigger when the stock reach 0.

Its also show the location of the vending machine using gps module and blynk app widget. In the app we can see the map showing the location of the vending machine.
